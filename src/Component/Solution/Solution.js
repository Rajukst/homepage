                  At HotelHub we constantly enhance our Products and Services to
                  support our customers. Safety and hygiene are of utmost
                  importance to travellers and the HotelHub API has now been
                  enhanced to indicate the newly added safety features. All the
                  booking tools using this API can display the Safe to Stay
                  information in their UI, enabling agents and travellers choose
                  the right hotel with confidence. We understand that the
                  priority is to ensure travellers are fully informed about the
                  health and safety protocols maintained by hotels and the
                  information provided can be confidently relied upon whilst
                  booking their accommodation.

                <p className="card-text">
                  The HotelHub HotelConnect is a user-friendly app that deeply
                  integrates with the agent GDS terminal enabling hotels to be
                  booked in less than 10 seconds whenever an overnight stay
                  opportunity is detected in a travellerâ€™s itinerary. As the
                  agent is booking a travel segment, HotelConnect proactively
                  responds with a personalised hotel shopping list without the
                  agent having to explicitly shop for hotels. HotelConnect does
                  this intelligently in the background and works in an assistive
                  manner to support agents and drive up productivity.
